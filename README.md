# osu-dump
Dumps all of osu! mapsets

If you need this please use an already generated JSON from the release tab : https://github.com/Tina-otoge/osu-dump/releases

Currently the results only include title, artist, id and mapper ID, as I did not need anything else.

If you are going to need more fields or different filters that the one used, please keep the timer to a reasonable amount to not put excessive strain on the API servers.
